## Working Code Notes

The working code for this assignment assumes that you've downloaded and extracted the dataset in your working directory.

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

At the end of the extraction, your working directory should have a directory called exdata-data-household_power_consumption, which contains the household_power_consumption.txt file.

Each R file reads the data in from the file and draws the appropriate plot(s). You will need around 200 MB of memory available or more to run these R scripts.
